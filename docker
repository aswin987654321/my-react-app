# Step 1: Build the React application
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Copy the rest of the application files to the container
COPY . .

# Set Node.js environment variable for OpenSSL
ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

# Build the React application for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the application using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the previous stage to the Nginx web root
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx when the container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
